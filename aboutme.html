    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h4>Hey there!</h4>
<p>My name is Megan! I'm a former Video Producer/Editor turned Software Engineer! My belief about life is that everything has a story. Even coding!
</p>

<p>I enjoy using my expertise from the creative field in my coding. Sometimes, you need to 
    figure out a new creative way to work around a project, whether that's in editing a video or 
    rewriting code.
</p>

<p>I'm a proud graduate from the University of North Texas. After graduation,
    I worked on both freelance and full time video projects with different companies including Kwik Trip and
    AT&T.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, I can usually be found writing short stories for fun (would love to be published one day!),
    baking, spending time with my family and friend, and working on puzzles. I'm a proud dog mom of a corgi named Ophelia (Ophie for short) and cat mom of
    a cat named Lolo.
